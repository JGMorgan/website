## Website

This repo contains the 2016-2017 ACM website. For the most part, the site is static.
However, we are planning to shift this on a full-stack tech stack with a full-blown 
**React.JS** components-based front-end architecture and a **Node.JS/SQL** 
backend architecture. Currently, this repository automatically deploys at our production 
server using Git Hooks.

This website will be the hub for the following club needs:
* Events dates and times
* Event video recordings and complementary workshop notes
* Social Media References
* ... and many more!
